    <h2>The Beast</h2>
    <p>To construct a fear of the beast think what your character does not know and find a way to make that dangerous.</p>
    <p>The most obvious manifestation of the beast is monsters: the awful things that lurk in dungeonswith sharp teeth and steely claws.Almost every creature found in a monster manual, or bestiary, is individually terrifying, and it is easy toempathize with a character who sees monsters that way.</p>
